We are thrilled to introduce our new monthly series, the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Journal Club, designed to promote learning and intellectual development within DCEG. This Journal Club offers a platform for us to stay current with recent research, explore new findings, and participate in thought-provoking discussions alongside our colleagues. 
 
Our first Journal Club meeting is scheduled for 11-12pm, May 10, 2023.
