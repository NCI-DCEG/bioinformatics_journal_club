The Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Journal Club is designed to promote learning and intellectual development within DCEG. This Journal Club offers a platform for us to stay current with recent research, explore new findings, and participate in thought-provoking discussions alongside our colleagues. 

We invite you to contribute to this dynamic environment by recommending a paper that has captured your interest. Please submit your suggestions at the [journal club GitHub repo discussion forum](https://github.com/NCI-DCEG/bioinformatics_journal_club/discussions). Your participation is key to maintaining the richness of our discussions and the breadth of our learning. In addition to paper suggestions, we are always looking for volunteers who are willing to lead our discussions or present on topics of interest.
