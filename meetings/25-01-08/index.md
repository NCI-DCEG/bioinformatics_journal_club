###  The Geisinger DiscovEHR cohort: 233,185 people with exome sequencing and longitudinal EHR data

Geisinger is an integrated health system serving patients in Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania; patients are eligible to participate in the MyCode Community Health Initiative, a system-wide biorepository of blood and DNA samples for broad research purposes. The DiscovEHR cohort consists of a subset of individuals who consented to participate in the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative and who have exome- and EHR-linked data. Exome sequencing was performed in collaboration with the Regeneron Genetics Center on a total of 233,185 participants. Genetic and clinical data from this cohort is being used by DCEG investigators for a variety of studies.
