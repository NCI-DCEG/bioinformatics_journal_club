###  Utilizing Commercial Real-World Data: Truveta

Truveta is a real-word data (RWD) resource that collects electronic health record (HER) data from 30 US health systems, which covers more that 120 million patients, 900 hospitals, and 20,000 clinics. The Truveta Language Model (TLM) is a multi-modal artificial intelligence (AI) model that is implemented to clean and extract both structured and unstructured data elements from the EHR. Additionally, EHR data is linked with social determinants of health (SDOH), mortality, and claims data. SDOH data is sourced from LexisNexis Risk Solutions which includes information on education, income, social support, transportation, and housing stability. We are currently utilizing this dataset to further our understanding of how SDOH factors impact survival outcomes among those with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor, to provide vital insight on diverse factors that impact patient care.
