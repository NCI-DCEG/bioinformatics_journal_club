###  Advancing Cancer Research Through Scalable, Real-World Evidence: Truveta’s Longitudinal Data Ecosystem

Truveta offers the U.S. government and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) a real-time,
research-ready data platform uniquely designed to support longitudinal oncology research
at national scale. With daily updates from over 30 U.S. health systems, representing more
than 125 million patients, Truveta enables access to comprehensive, de-identified patient
data through a secure, cloud-based platform without data lag or extraction delays. This
ensures timely surveillance, real-world effectiveness research, and regulatory-grade
evidence generation.

Truveta captures the full longitudinal clinical journey, offering an average of nearly 10 years
of patient data, and often more, per individual. This extensive temporal coverage enables
researchers to analyze patterns in pre-diagnosis care, symptom onset, staging, and
survivorship outcomes. Structured data from the electronic health record, including
medications, diagnoses, procedures, laboratory results, and imaging, is enriched with
natural language processing (NLP)-derived insights from unstructured clinical notes
supporting analysis of tumor characteristics, biomarkers, and treatment response.
To close critical gaps in real-world data, Truveta provides secure linkages to closed claims
(commercial and Medicare Fee-for-Service), mortality data, and disease-specific registries.
These integrations offer a complete view of care across payers and sites, enabling analysis of
treatment adherence, care coordination, and long-term outcomes beyond the original health
system.

Truveta also offers deterministic mother–baby linkage, providing high-fidelity connections
between maternal and neonatal records. This capability supports oncology research into
perinatal exposures, inherited cancer risk, and longitudinal health trajectories across
generations.

In addition, the Truveta Genome Project is building one of the world’s most diverse
genotypic–phenotypic datasets, linking genomic data with clinical histories to power
precision oncology research. This enables stratified analyses of genetic risk, treatment
response, and disparities in genomic testing and targeted therapy uptake.
With built-in analytic tools, regulatory-grade de-identification, privacy safeguards, and
support for cohort creation and reproducibility, Truveta’s platform offers the NCI a powerful
and practical resource for advancing equitable, real-time, and data-driven cancer research
and care.
