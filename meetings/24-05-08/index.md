### Research Talk:
- Establishing a single-cell eQTL dataset of lung tissues from Asian women never-smokers to elucidate cell-type specific genetic regulation

### Meeting Details

**Date**: 24-05-08

**Time**: 11:00-12:00 

**Location**: Hybrid: Rm 1E032/34/ and via Teams 

**Presenter**: Dr. Thong Luong

### Abstract:
Single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) has enabled researchers to link variants to gene(s) in a cell-type specific manner, furthering our understanding of the etiology of complex traits such as cancer. However, current sc-eQTL resources are either from blood or cell culture or are lacking ancestral diversity. To alleviate these issues, we are building a sc-eQTL dataset of normal lung tissue from Asian population, while addressing common challenges such as cost and isolation of relevant cell types.
