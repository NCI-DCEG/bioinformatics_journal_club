### Research Talk:
- Transcriptomic profiling of lung adenocarcinoma from never-smokers reveals molecular subtypes with clinical implications

### Meeting Details

**Date**: 2024-03-13

**Time**: 11:30-12:30 

**Location**: Hybrid: Rm 1E032/34/ and via Teams 

**Presenter**: Dr. Wei Zhao

### Abstract:
I will present my research, which is also the largest study worldwide, on the transcriptome of lung cancer in never smokers. We identified three transcriptome-based subtypes and verified the association of these subtypes with genomic changes and histological features. These subtypes have profound effects on clinical outcomes. We then developed a 60-gene predictor that recapitulates the expression subtype classification and their prognostic properties, which could be used in clinical settings. All results were validated in an external data set.
