###  FAIR and Reproducible Science in the age of AI: guiding principles

In an era where AI accelerates discovery, safeguarding both FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and reproducibility is paramount. This presentation outlines a set of guiding principles that build on FAIR’s foundation to address AI’s unique challenges. We demonstrate how containerized workflows and transparent audit trails ensure that data and models remain findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, while also guaranteeing reproducible results. By embedding human-in-the-loop checkpoints, interpretability tools, and versioned registries into research workflows, we balance AI’s computational power with rigorous validation and accountability. Ultimately, these principles foster more reliable, transparent, and collaborative science in the age of AI. 
(Presentation will include a short demo implementation of the guiding principles)
