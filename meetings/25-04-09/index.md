###  Towards a FAIRer Real World Data Commons: real-time processing of individual level patient discharge reports collected by NY's SPARCS program. 

To support quality improvement and research, the New York State Department of Health requires hospitals to submit patient discharge reports to the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) Program, managed by the Office of Health Services Quality and Analytics (https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs). Established in 1979 through collaboration between the healthcare industry and government, SPARCS aims to, among other goals, develop care management models that decrease patient readmission rates. The program has evolved to provide access to approximately two million new discharge records each year via state-of-the-art Socrata APIs. This presentation will explore the specific data available through SPARCS and the configuration of FAIR mechanisms enabling analysis by members of the public and by researchers, alike. We will conclude by examining the inherent trade-offs associated with open access to detailed, individual-level, real-world health data.
